# FindSim

Framework for Integration of Neuronal Data and SIgnaling Models. The associated paper is available 
at [https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2018.00038](https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2018.00038)

# About

The FindSim project maps models of neural and cellular signaling to 
experimental protocols and readouts. It runs the experiment on the model, and
provides a score that reports how closely the two match.

=============================================================================
# Quick start: 
A. Run one of the example experiments on the default model, generating a graph to compare model to experiment:  
	To run the script, run the command in python and `synSynth7.g` is the latest model that is tested out the worksheets.  
  	>python findSim.py Curated/FindSim-Jain2009-Fig2B.tsv --model synSynth7.g  
  				or  
  	>python findSim.py Curated/FindSim-Jain2009-Fig2B.tsv  

B. Batch run:  
	-runAllParallel.py script runs the findSim program on all tsv files in the specified directory, computes their scores, and prints out basic stats of the scores. It can do this in parallel using Python's multiprocessing library.  
	
	>python runAllParallel.py Curated -n 8  (run of the entire set of `Curated` experiments on 8 cores)  
						or  
	>python runAllParallel.py Directory (of tsv files) -n (Number of processes to spawn) --model (synSynth7.g)  

C. Syntax help:  
	>python findSim.py -h  
	>python runAllParallel.py -h

Two papers were used as the initial basis for the models, and which in turn
refer to a large number of experimental studies for their data:

Two further papers were used for some of the experiments:  
	- Gu J, et al. Beta1,4-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase III down-regulates neurite outgrowth induced by costimulation of epidermal growth factor and integrins through the Ras/ERK signaling pathway in PC12 cells. Glycobiology. 2004 Feb;14(2):177-86. Epub 2003 Oct 23
